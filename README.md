## Overview
This project aims to develop an automated loan default prediction model that helps LoanAnalytics Inc. identify high-risk borrowers early in the loan approval process. By leveraging historical loan data and machine learning algorithms, the model will predict the likelihood of borrower defaults, streamline the loan approval process, and minimize financial losses.

## Key Objectives
1. Predict Borrower Default Risk
Develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on their loan.
Use historical data to identify patterns and trends associated with default risk.
2. Improve Loan Approval Efficiency
Reduce loan processing times by integrating predictive insights into the approval workflow.
Automate risk assessment to minimize manual intervention and enhance decision-making speed.
3. Minimize Financial Losses
Accurately flag high-risk borrowers to take preventive actions, such as:
Offering adjusted interest rates.
Requiring collateral or additional security measures.
Enhance profitability by mitigating potential losses from loan defaults.

## Model Evaluation
Accuracy: Measure the overall correctness of the model.
Precision and Recall: Evaluate how well the model identifies high-risk borrowers.
ROC-AUC Score: Assess the model's ability to distinguish between defaulting and non-defaulting borrowers.
